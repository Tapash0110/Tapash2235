To tackle this problem , I implemented the logistic regression algorithm and used the sklearn ibrary of python which is inbuilt for calculating the f1 score.
I used models like Standardscaler and Robustscaler for improving the f1 score in my code.
I also used the L2 method of regularization in my code.
